# Statistics-II

Welcome to the Statistics II course. The main purpose of the Statistic II is to ensure that students are confident applying the steps in regression modelling process. This course introduces regression modelling, including data exploration, correlation, regression with a single predictor variable, multiple explanatory variables, confounding factors, model interactions, model checking, model fitting, hands-on examples, explore a model created using R, and interpret results. The practical session will require very basic level use of R, but all necessary scripts will be provided to complete your individual assignments. This course will allow students to apply previous knowledge and branching out their skills in data science and machine learning techniques to resolve real world problems. Happy coding!

This repository includes contents, assignments and codes of the course Statistics II: Datasets that will be used in classes, codes step-by-step to applying to your individual assigments, and outcomes examples.
